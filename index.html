            <p>Scribbles of abstract thoughts litter the corners of her mind, as she weaves together fragmented memories and half-formed dreams. Colors swirl and dance behind her closed eyelids, as she tries to grasp the intangible, to put words to the ineffable. The night air is thick with the scent of jasmine, and she inhales deeply, feeling the cool breeze on her skin. She wonders where the wind has come from, where it is going, and what secrets it carries with it. She closes her eyes again, and lets the world fall away.</p>
